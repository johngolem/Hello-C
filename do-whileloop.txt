The do..while loop is similar to the while loop with one important difference. The body of do...while loop is executed at least once. Only then, the test expression is evaluated.

The syntax of the do...while loop is:

do {
  // the body of the loop
}
while (testExpression);


How do...while loop works?
The body of do...while loop is executed once. Only then, the testExpression is evaluated.
If testExpression is true, the body of the loop is executed again and testExpression is evaluated once more.
This process goes on until testExpression becomes false.
If testExpression is false, the loop ends.

// Program to add numbers until the user enters zero

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  double number, sum = 0;

  // the body of the loop is executed at least once
  do {
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &number);
    sum += number;
  }
  while(number != 0.0);

  printf("Sum = %.2lf",sum);

  return 0;
}

Enter a number: 1.5
Enter a number: 2.4
Enter a number: -3.4
Enter a number: 4.2
Enter a number: 0
Sum = 4.70


Here, we have used a do...while loop to prompt the user to enter a number. The loop works as long as the input number is not 0.

The do...while loop executes at least once i.e. the first iteration runs without checking the condition. The condition is checked only after the first iteration has been executed.
