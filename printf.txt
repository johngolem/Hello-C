The fundamental data types in c are int, float and char. Today, we're discussing int and float data types.

The printf() function prints the given statement to the console. The syntax is printf("format string",argument_list);.
In the function, if we are using an integer, character, string or float as argument, then in the format string we have to write %d (integer), %c (character), %s (string), %f (float) respectively.

The scanf() function reads the input data from the console. The syntax is scanf("format string",argument_list);. 
For ex: The scanf("%d",&number) statement reads integer number from the console and stores the given value in variable number .

To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, the command is scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), where  m and n are the two integers.
